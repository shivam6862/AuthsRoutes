   ```
3. Enter your API in `.env` of frontend directory
   ```sh
   VITE_REACT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```
4. Enter your MONGODB DATABASE URL and put it in `.env` file in backend directory
   ```sh
   MONGODB_URL= "your mongodb url"
   ```
5. Make the database in your mongodb server named as `AuthsRoute` and make the following collection
   ```sh
   users
   ```

## Description

AuthsRoute is an innovative web application that simplifies the process of authintication.<br/>

Our project is a web application built using React and Node.js that allows users to authenticate and access protected content. The authentication process involves user registration, login, and session management, which is handled by the Node.js backend using libraries like JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).<br/>

When a user registers, they can enter their email and password, which is securely hashed and stored in a database. The user can then log in using their email and password, and the server will authenticate the user using the stored hashed password. If the authentication is successful, the server will return a JWT to the client, which can be used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected routes in the React frontend.<br/>

In the frontend, users can access protected content by navigating to authenticated routes. If a user attempts to access a protected route without being authenticated, they will be redirected to the sign-in page. Once logged in, the user will have access to the protected content until they sign-out or their session expires.<br/>

Our project implements best practices for security and user authentication to ensure that user data is protected and only accessible to authorized users.<br/>
